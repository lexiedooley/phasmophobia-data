Welcome to My Phasmophobia Data! 

Here's the link: https://phasmophobia-data-app.fly.dev/

The app was made so users/players can track what information they're seeing while playing, purely as a curiosity as to what ghosts they're seeing the most or what rooms they're commonly spawning/starting in. This was something I was tracking before the class started so I wanted to make this for my personal use to track this information more easily and in a database.

I used HTML, CSS, JS, MongoDB and Mongoose to create this App

I would like to add a login/logout feature so that information is stored per user, and personal data isn't being modified by anyone else on accident. 

Adding more CSS would also be nice but the App as it stands now functions exactly how I'd like and can track the information I want and need.
